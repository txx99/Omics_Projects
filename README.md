# Omics Projects
Various omics analysis projects in one repository.

## Glioblastoma-Analysis
Re-analysing gene expression data from glioblastoma samples as performed by [Wang et al. 2023](https://github.com/WesleyWang913/Wang_et_al_2023_Acta_Neuro_Comms_Code?tab=readme-ov-file). 
We perform DEA using R's limma package and attempt to recreate the authors' enhanced volcano plot and gene ontology enrichment plot.

## OCSC-Character-Analysis
Original group project investigating how well in vitro samples retain the stem-like characteristics seen in the initial biopsy tissue of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. We perform DEA and GSEA, with visualisations using PCA, heatmap, and volcano plots.

## scRNA Analysis
Various scRNA sequence analysis projects, currently using the Seurat package and datasets from 10x Genomics. Includes IDing highly variable genes, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cluster annotation.
