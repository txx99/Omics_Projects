# Omics Projects
Various omics analysis projects in one repository.

## Glioblastoma-Analysis
Re-analysing gene expression data from glioblastoma samples as performed by [Wang et al. 2023](https://github.com/WesleyWang913/Wang_et_al_2023_Acta_Neuro_Comms_Code?tab=readme-ov-file). 
We perform DEA using R's limma package and attempt to recreate the authors' enhanced volcano plot and gene ontology enrichment plot.

## OCSC-Character-Analysis
Original group project investigating how well in vitro samples retain the stem-like characteristics seen in the initial biopsy tissue of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. We perform DEA and GSEA, with visualisations using PCA, heatmap, and volcano plots.

## scRNA Analysis
Following [Arpudhamary V.'s](https://github.com/Marydoss-25/scRNA-Data-analysis-) tutorial for beginners in scRNA analysis, this notebook will learn to use the Seurat package to perform scRNA data analysis, including IDing highly variable genes, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cluster visualisation.
